Time spent on challenge: 4 hours
What I would do next: 
fix the right guesses list to be displayied sorted by the order of the random word to be guessed
make sure that any other answer in the inputs are covered to back to input
clean code (for example put the print staments of count of guesses outside the for loop, so we would only have it once in the program)
